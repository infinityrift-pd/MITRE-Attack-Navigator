# MITRE-Attack-Navigator
This script processes Jira tickets and Splunk detection rules that are created towards coverage of MITRE ATT&amp;CK Techniques, to generate a MITRE ATT&amp;CK Navigator layer for security technique visualisation. It combines security incidents from different data sources and maps them to MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques.
